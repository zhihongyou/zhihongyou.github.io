      <title>Dynamics of Active Liquid Interfaces</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling interfaces of phase-separating fluid mixtures is key to the creation of diverse functional soft materials. Traditionally, this is accomplished with surface-modifying chemical agents. Using experiment and theory, we studied how mechanical activity shapes soft interfaces that separate an active and a passive fluid. Chaotic flows in the active fluid give rise to giant interfacial fluctuations and noninertial propagating active waves. At high activities, stresses disrupt interface continuity and drive droplet generation, producing an emulsion-like active state composed of finite-sized droplets. When in contact with a solid boundary, active interfaces exhibit nonequilibrium wetting transitions, in which the fluid climbs the wall against gravity. These results demonstrate the promise of mechanically driven interfaces for creating a new class of soft active matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When active and passive fluids interact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incompatible liquids such as oil and water will phase separate with low interfacial tension. Adkins et al. investigated the dynamics of a one-dimensional interface separating an active nematic phase with a passive isotropic phase (see the Perspective by Palacci). They found a rich behavior of fluctuating interfaces in which the phase-separating fluids could form active emulsions that did not coarsen and in which droplets formed spontaneously. Macroscopic interfaces can also displayed propagating waves with a characteristic wave number and speed. Furthermore, the activity of one of the fluids, in which the addition of energy drove the ordering of that fluid, was able to modify the wetting transitions. The authors also observed active wetting of a solid surface whereby active extensile stresses parallel to the surface drove the fluid to climb a solid wall against gravity. —MSL&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Active nematic defects in compressible and incompressible flows</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We study two-dimensional active nematics on a substrate, comparing compressible and incompressible flows. Through simulations and theoretical analysis we show that arch patterns are stable in the compressible case but are unstable in an incompressible system. For compressible flows at high activity, stable arches organize in a smectic-like pattern, with associated global polar order of +1/2 nematic defects. By contrast, incompressible flows give rise to local nematic order of the +1/2 defects, consisting of anti-aligned pairs of neighboring defects, as previously established.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Confinement-induced self-organization in growing bacterial colonies</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigate the emergence of global alignment in colonies of dividing rod-shaped cells under confinement. Using molecular dynamics simulations and continuous modeling, we demonstrate that geometrical anisotropies in the confining environment give rise to an imbalance in the normal stresses, which, in turn, drives a collective rearrangement of the cells. This behavior crucially relies on the colony’s solid-like mechanical response at short time scales and can be recovered within the framework of active hydrodynamics upon modeling bacterial colonies as growing viscoelastic gels characterized by Maxwell-like stress relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nonreciprocity As a Generic Route To Traveling States</title>
      <link>https://zhihongyou.github.io/publication/you-20-nonrec-as-gener-route-to-travel-states/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://zhihongyou.github.io/publication/you-20-nonrec-as-gener-route-to-travel-states/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We examine a nonreciprocally coupled dynamical model of a mixture of two diffusing species. We demonstrate that nonreciprocity, which is encoded in the model via antagonistic cross-diffusivities, provides a generic mechanism for the emergence of traveling patterns in purely diffusive systems with conservative dynamics. In the absence of nonreciprocity, the binary fluid mixture undergoes a phase transition from a homogeneous mixed state to a demixed state with spatially separated regions rich in one of the two components. Above a critical value of the parameter tuning nonreciprocity, the static demixed pattern acquires a finite velocity, resulting in a state that breaks both spatial and time-reversal symmetry, as well as the reflection parity of the static pattern. We elucidate the generic nature of the transition to traveling patterns using a minimal model that can be studied analytically. Our work has direct relevance to nonequilibrium assembly in mixtures of chemically interacting colloids that are known to exhibit nonreciprocal effective interactions, as well as to mixtures of active and passive agents where traveling states of the type predicted here have been observed in simulations. It also provides insight on transitions to traveling and oscillatory states seen in a broad range of nonreciprocal systems with nonconservative dynamics, from reaction–diffusion and prey–predators models to multispecies mixtures of microorganisms with antagonistic interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective interactions that break action–reaction symmetry are ubiquitous in systems where interactions are mediated by a nonequilibrium environment. They are also the norm in the living world. By examining the dynamics of a diffusing binary mixture, we demonstrate that antagonistic cross-diffusivities can drive the transition from static to traveling spatial patterns. In the context of an analytically tractable model, we elucidate the nature of the transition and demonstrate that the emergence of traveling or oscillating patterns is a generic consequence of nonreciprocity in multispecies systems described by scalar fields. Our work is directly relevant to the understanding and control of nonequilibrium assembly in mixtures of chemically interacting colloids.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mono- To Multilayer Transition in Growing Bacterial Colonies</title>
      <link>https://zhihongyou.github.io/publication/you-19-mono-to-multil-trans-growin-bacter-colon/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://zhihongyou.github.io/publication/you-19-mono-to-multil-trans-growin-bacter-colon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition from monolayers to multilayered structures in bacterial colonies is a fundamental step in biofilm development. Observed across different morphotypes and species, this transition is triggered within freely growing bacterial microcolonies comprising a few hundred cells. Using a combination of numerical simulations and analytical modeling, here we demonstrate that this transition originates from the competition between growth-induced in-plane active stresses and vertical restoring forces, due to the cell-substrate interactions. Using a simple chainlike colony of laterally confined cells, we show that the transition sets when individual cells become unstable to rotations; thus it is localized and mechanically deterministic. Asynchronous cell division renders the process stochastic, so that all the critical parameters that control the onset of the transition are continuously distributed random variables. Here we demonstrate that the occurrence of the first division in the colony can be approximated as a Poisson process in the limit of large cell numbers. This allows us to approximately calculate the probability distribution function of the position and time associated with the first extrusion. The rate of such a Poisson process can be identified as the order parameter of the transition, thus highlighting its mixed deterministic-stochastic nature.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Growth-induced self-organization in bacterial colonies</title>
      <link>https://zhihongyou.github.io/publication/you-2019-growth/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://zhihongyou.github.io/publication/you-2019-growth/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mechanical forces are known to play an important role in bacterial colonies. In this dissertation, we study the self-organization at various stages of growing bacterial colonies, and focus on the mechanical effects of cell growth. In a freely expanding monolayer, cell growth induces an extensile active stress, which competes with the system orientational elastic stress, resulting in a chaotic dynamics as well as the formation of nematic domains. When the colony is confined laterally, the interplay of cell growth and confinement gives rise to a globally anisotropic stress, and drives the cells to align perpendicular to the direction of confinement. For large colonies, the in-plane growth-induced stress is large to enough to compete with the vertical restoring forces from the substrate, and trigger a mono-to-multilayer transition. Despite the transition being mechanically deterministic, asynchronous cell division renders the process stochastic, so that all the critical parameters that control the onset of the transition are continuously distributed random variables. These results not only advance our understanding of the self-organization in growing bacterial colonies, but also shed new lights on the physics of growing cellular systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Statistical properties of autonomous flows in 2D active nematics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We study the dynamics of a tunable 2D active nematic liquid crystal composed
of microtubules and kinesin motors confined to an oil–water interface. Kinesin motors
continuously inject mechanical energy into the system through ATP hydrolysis, powering
the relative microscopic sliding of adjacent microtubules, which in turn generates
macroscale autonomous flows and chaotic dynamics. We use particle image velocimetry
to quantify two-dimensional flows of active nematics and extract their statistical
properties. In agreement with the hydrodynamic theory, we find that the vortex areas
comprising the chaotic flows are exponentially distributed, which allows us to extract
the characteristic system length scale. We probe the dependence of this length scale
on the ATP concentration, which is the experimental knob that tunes the magnitude
of the active stress. Our data suggest a possible mapping between the ATP concentration
and the active stress that is based on the Michaelis–Menten kinetics that governs
the motion of individual kinesin motors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Geometry and Mechanics of Microdomains in Growing Bacterial Colonies</title>
      <link>https://zhihongyou.github.io/publication/you-18-geomet-mechan-microd-growin-bacter-colon/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial colonies are abundant on living and nonliving surfaces and are known to mediate a broad range of processes in ecology, medicine, and industry. Although extensively researched, from single cells to demographic scales, a comprehensive biomechanical picture, highlighting the cell-to-colony dynamics, is still lacking. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations and continuous modeling, we investigate the geometrical and mechanical properties of a bacterial colony growing on a substrate with a free boundary and demonstrate that such an expanding colony self-organizes into a “mosaic” of microdomains consisting of highly aligned cells. The emergence of microdomains is mediated by two competing forces: the steric forces between neighboring cells, which favor cell alignment, and the extensile stresses due to cell growth that tend to reduce the local orientational order and thereby distort the system. This interplay results in an exponential distribution of the domain areas and sets a characteristic length scale proportional to the square root of the ratio between the system orientational stiffness and the magnitude of the extensile active stress. Our theoretical predictions are finally compared with experiments with freely growing E. coli microcolonies, finding quantitative agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Characteristics and Applications of Two-Dimensional Light Scattering By Cylindrical Tubes Based on Ray Tracing</title>
      <link>https://zhihongyou.github.io/publication/you-12-charac-applic-two-dimen-light/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intensity distribution of light scattered by a capillary tube filled with a liquid is studied using geometrical optics or ray tracing. Several intensity step points are found in the scattering pattern due to contributions from different geometrical rays. The scattering angles of these intensity step points vary with the capillary parameters, i.e., with the inner and outer radii of the capillary wall and the refractive indices of the liquid and the wall material. The relations between the scattering angles of the step points and the capillary parameters are analyzed using the reflection law and Snell’s law. A method is developed to determine the capillary parameters from measurements of the scattering angles of the step points. An experiment is designed to provide measured data from which the capillary parameters can be obtained by the proposed method. It is shown that this method provides capillary parameters of high precision.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analysis of Light Scattered By a Capillary To Measure a Liquid&#39;s Index of Refraction</title>
      <link>https://zhihongyou.github.io/publication/you-12-analy-light-scatt-by-capil/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://zhihongyou.github.io/publication/you-12-analy-light-scatt-by-capil/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple optical method to measure a liquid’s refractive index using a capillary is experimentally demonstrated. The analysis and simulation of the intensity distribution of light scattered by the capillary are accomplished with a ray tracing method, and three intensity step points are obtained. By measuring the scattering angles of these step points, we can obtain the refractive index of the liquid in the capillary, as well as the refractive index and the diameter ratio of the capillary. With a laser, a spectrometer, and a capillary, we can easily perform an interesting undergraduate physics experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
