abstract  ="We study the dynamics of a tunable 2D active nematic liquid crystal composed of microtubules and kinesin motors confined to an oil–water interface. Kinesin motors continuously inject mechanical energy into the system through ATP hydrolysis{,} powering the relative microscopic sliding of adjacent microtubules{,} which in turn generates macroscale autonomous flows and chaotic dynamics. We use particle image velocimetry to quantify two-dimensional flows of active nematics and extract their statistical properties. In agreement with the hydrodynamic theory{,} we find that the vortex areas comprising the chaotic flows are exponentially distributed{,} which allows us to extract the characteristic system length scale. We probe the dependence of this length scale on the ATP concentration{,} which is the experimental knob that tunes the magnitude of the active stress. Our data suggest a possible mapping between the ATP concentration and the active stress that is based on the Michaelis–Menten kinetics that governs the motion of individual kinesin motors."}
