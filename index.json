We demonstrate that nonreciprocity, which is encoded in the model via antagonistic cross-diffusivities, provides a generic mechanism for the emergence of traveling patterns in purely diffusive systems with conservative dynamics. In the absence of nonreciprocity, the binary fluid mixture undergoes a phase transition from a homogeneous mixed state to a demixed state with spatially separated regions rich in one of the two components. Above a critical value of the parameter tuning nonreciprocity, the static demixed pattern acquires a finite velocity, resulting in a state that breaks both spatial and time-reversal symmetry, as well as the reflection parity of the static pattern. We elucidate the generic nature of the transition to traveling patterns using a minimal model that can be studied analytically. Our work has direct relevance to nonequilibrium assembly in mixtures of chemically interacting colloids that are known to exhibit nonreciprocal effective interactions, as well as to mixtures of active and passive agents where traveling states of the type predicted here have been observed in simulations. It also provides insight on transitions to traveling and oscillatory states seen in a broad range of nonreciprocal systems with nonconservative dynamics, from reaction–diffusion and prey–predators models to multispecies mixtures of microorganisms with antagonistic interactions.\nSignificance:\nEffective interactions that break action–reaction symmetry are ubiquitous in systems where interactions are mediated by a nonequilibrium environment. They are also the norm in the living world. By examining the dynamics of a diffusing binary mixture, we demonstrate that antagonistic cross-diffusivities can drive the transition from static to traveling spatial patterns. In the context of an analytically tractable model, we elucidate the nature of the transition and demonstrate that the emergence of traveling or oscillating patterns is a generic consequence of nonreciprocity in multispecies systems described by scalar fields.

Using a simple chainlike colony of laterally confined cells, we show that the transition sets when individual cells become unstable to rotations; thus it is localized and mechanically deterministic. Asynchronous cell division renders the process stochastic, so that all the critical parameters that control the onset of the transition are continuously distributed random variables. Here we demonstrate that the occurrence of the first division in the colony can be approximated as a Poisson process in the limit of large cell numbers. This allows us to approximately calculate the probability distribution function of the position and time associated with the first extrusion.

In a freely expanding monolayer, cell growth induces an extensile active stress, which competes with the system orientational elastic stress, resulting in a chaotic dynamics as well as the formation of nematic domains. When the colony is confined laterally, the interplay of cell growth and confinement gives rise to a globally anisotropic stress, and drives the cells to align perpendicular to the direction of confinement. For large colonies, the in-plane growth-induced stress is large to enough to compete with the vertical restoring forces from the substrate, and trigger a mono-to-multilayer transition.

Here, using molecular dynamics simulations and continuous modeling, we investigate the geometrical and mechanical properties of a bacterial colony growing on a substrate with a free boundary and demonstrate that such an expanding colony self-organizes into a “mosaic” of microdomains consisting of highly aligned cells. The emergence of microdomains is mediated by two competing forces: the steric forces between neighboring cells, which favor cell alignment, and the extensile stresses due to cell growth that tend to reduce the local orientational order and thereby distort the system. This interplay results in an exponential distribution of the domain areas and sets a characteristic length scale proportional to the square root of the ratio between the system orientational stiffness and the magnitude of the extensile active stress.

Several intensity step points are found in the scattering pattern due to contributions from different geometrical rays. The scattering angles of these intensity step points vary with the capillary parameters, i.e., with the inner and outer radii of the capillary wall and the refractive indices of the liquid and the wall material. The relations between the scattering angles of the step points and the capillary parameters are analyzed using the reflection law and Snell’s law. A method is developed to determine the capillary parameters from measurements of the scattering angles of the step points. An experiment is designed to provide measured data from which the capillary parameters can be obtained by the proposed method. It is shown that this method provides capillary parameters of high precision.\n","date":1354665600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655231879,"objectID":"3f89a982c7afbff056f0d0dd9944cb1f","permalink":"https://zhihongyou.github.io/publication/you-12-charac-applic-two-dimen-light/","publishdate":"2022-06-14T19:02:38.993311Z","relpermalink":"/publication/you-12-charac-applic-two-dimen-light/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract:\nThe intensity distribution of light scattered by a capillary tube filled with a liquid is studied using geometrical optics or ray tracing.

The analysis and simulation of the intensity distribution of light scattered by the capillary are accomplished with a ray tracing method, and three intensity step points are obtained. By measuring the scattering angles of these step points, we can obtain the refractive index of the liquid in the capillary, as well as the refractive index and the diameter ratio of the capillary. With a laser, a spectrometer, and a capillary, we can easily perform an interesting undergraduate physics experiment.\n","date":1342483200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655231879,"objectID":"b3e1d82e506c36c0ceb01bd98d4ec2d3","permalink":"https://zhihongyou.github.io/publication/you-12-analy-light-scatt-by-capil/","publishdate":"2022-06-14T19:02:38.893267Z","relpermalink":"/publication/you-12-analy-light-scatt-by-capil/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract:\nA simple optical method to measure a liquid’s refractive index using a capillary is experimentally demonstrated.
